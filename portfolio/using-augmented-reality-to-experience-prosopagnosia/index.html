        <p>
          This project aims to let people see through another&rsquo;s eyes. We
          will simulate the subjective experience of face blindness
          (prosopagnosia) through augmented reality (AR) manipulation of facial
          features. Informed by research on neural encoding in the fusiform face
          area, the system captures live video input and distorts faces by
          altering their geometry and texture. The aim of the project is to
          accurately simulate the subjective experience of someone with
          prosopagnosia, allowing for an immersive exploration of how disrupted
          facial recognition impacts perception and social interaction. By
          merging neuroscience insights with AR technology, this work
          contributes to both the artistic exploration and scientific
          understanding of face perception disorders. (<a
