      <description>&lt;p&gt;Descartes famously kicked off an era of Western philosophy with his famous statement &amp;ldquo;Cogito, ergo sum&amp;rdquo; (I think, therefore I am). He went on to develop a dualistic theory of mind and body. The theory posits that the world is composed of fundamentally two types of &amp;lsquo;stuff&amp;rsquo;: spirit and matter&amp;ndash;and that these two types of stuff interact with each other. For a long time, most bought into this idea, but in modern circles of philosophy, it has largely gone out of fashion in favor of materialism (in various forms).&lt;/p&gt;</description>
