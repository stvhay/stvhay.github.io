          <p><em>Do we live in a world of ideas?</em> &#x1f4a1;</p>
          <p>
            Descartes famously kicked off an era of Western philosophy with
            &ldquo;Cogito, ergo sum&rdquo;—an attempt to establish a basis for
            human existence and knowledge that assumed as little as possible.
            Out of this idea sprung a dualistic theory of mind and body. The
            theory posits that the world is composed of fundamentally two types
            of &lsquo;stuff&rsquo;: stuff that extends into three-dimensional
            space (matter) and stuff that doesn&rsquo;t (ideas). For a long time
            this idea was popular. It was partly popular because it left fairly
            explicit room in philosophy for a god concept, but the basic idea
            also made some intuitive sense. How else do we account for our
            feeling of consciousness? However, in modern circles of philosophy
            and science, dualism has largely gone out of fashion in favor of
            materialism (one type of stuff). Stripping away this notion of
            &ldquo;ideas&rdquo; as an independent manifestation from
            &ldquo;matter&rdquo; seems more sensible nowadays where more
            hard-nosed empiricism so fundamentally shapes our society. And,
            frankly, dualism raises some difficult problems upon close
            examination. The hardest problem boils down to this question: if
            there are two types of &ldquo;stuff,&rdquo; then how do they
            interact with each other?
          </p>
          <p>
            In the 17th century, however, things weren&rsquo;t quite as settled.
            Irish philosopher George Berkeley advocated for the other solution
            to this philosophical conundrum: the world (including all matter)
            was composed only of ideas
            <sup id="fnref:1"
              ><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"
                >1</a
              ></sup
            >. Like modern materialists, he didn&rsquo;t really understand how
            dualism could make much sense. Setting aside the problems of dualism
            for a moment, my question is:
            <strong
              >is Berkeleyan idealism a useful tool that offers us a relevant
              perspective when we study neuroscience</strong
            >?
          </p>
          <p>
            My line of thinking comes from reading a 2014 paper<sup id="fnref:2"
              ><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"
                >2</a
              ></sup
            >
            that summarizes, and to a degree challenges, the neuroscience
            research on scene analysis—the study of how our brain turns
            information (materialist philosophers like the term
            &ldquo;sense-data&rdquo;) into an internal, ultimately material,
            representation of the world. It then argues that scene analysis is
            not only an incredibly hard problem, but that many of the modern
            ways we study this problem fail to address some very fundamental
            questions.
          </p>
          <p>
            The paper points out that a lot of empirical research into scene
            analysis is conducted using very simplified forms—lines and basic
            geometric figures on simple backgrounds and using neutral lighting.
            Arguably, this simplified approach makes sense because it provides a
            controlled experimental environment. In such an environment
            scientists can create a simple and reproducable baseline and then
            vary from that baseline one parameter at a time. Unfortunately,
            while this research framework has yielded many useful insights, the
            paper argues that we remain relatively stuck on how we map those
            insights to ecologically relevant scene analysis problems that all
            animals are constantly solving.<sup id="fnref:3"
              ><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"
                >3</a

          </p>
          <p>
            As I was reading, I was thinking about Berkeley&rsquo;s idealism. As
            I learn more about human perception in general, the more I realize
            that our perceptual world is far more like a Star Trek holodeck—<em
              >a constructed reality</em
            >—than some kind of direct<sup id="fnref:4"
              ><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"
                >4</a
              ></sup
            >
            perception. Of course, I am not the first person to have this
            idea<sup id="fnref:5"
              ><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"

            and its generally given the name <em>predictive coding</em>,
            <em>predictive processing</em>, or (more creatively)
            <em>controlled hallucination</em>. In a nutshell, our brains cannot
            process the sensory information we recieve quickly or energetically
            efficiently enough to reach the performance levels we do. Not only
            is our brain heavily involved in numerous layers of represental
            transformations when processing sense-data, our resulting real-time
            representational model of the world (essentially our engine of
            consciousness) is informed by a shockingly tiny subset of the
            available information (neurons are expensive!<sup id="fnref:6"
              ><a href="#fn:6" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"
                >6</a
              ></sup
            >). Because of this limitation, our consciousness experience is
            mostly an informed guess about what is going on in the world. Our
            lived conscious experience is therefore much less objective than it
            seems, and is in fact the opposite—deeply subjective. So, while I
            don&rsquo;t think the world is built of ideas, our perception of the
            world is <em>literally</em> built of ideas! So, it makes sense to me
            to put ideas at the center of how materialists think about
            consciousness.
          </p>
          <p>
            One example from neuroscience of our constructed reality are
            saccades. Saccades are rapid eye movements that constantly shift our
            gaze. The movements are essential for our ability to process visual
            information because (as mentioned) we physically don&rsquo;t have
            the neural bandwidth to take in all of our visual field in without
            heavy compression<sup id="fnref:7"
              ><a href="#fn:7" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"
                >7</a
              ></sup
            >. Our brain controls where our eyes are pointed based on a mix of
            unconscious neural control systems tracking our head, body, and eye
            position. Random saccade and even smaller microsaccade movements, as
            well as high-level task-driven signals continuously, and mostly
            unconsciously, determine our attention. All of the high-acuity
            visual data we get (e.g. detail and color) comes via a shockingly
            narrow field of view (a few degrees arc), and the rest we fill in
            with prior knowledge and expectations (memories and saccades) and
            much more limited peripheral visual data.
          </p>
          <p>
            Moreover, this motif recurs throughout the perceptive systems of
            most animals. For example, the scene analysis paper discusses
            jumping spiders having three pairs of different kinds of eyes. One
            of the pairs provides detail, and provides it as a one-dimensional
            vertical slit. The spider uses these eyes to scan selected areas of
            its visual field horizontally like a crazed dot-matrix
            <a
              href="https://youtu.be/A_vXA058EDY?t=23"
              target="_blank"
              rel="noopener noreferrer"
              >printer</a
            >. Like us, the spider then assembles these samples into a
            three-dimensional representation of the world—the only way to
            explain its complex behaviors. Unlike us, visual sensing is
            performed by three distinct kinds of eyes each specializing on
            certain kinds of information.

            Bats have even more impressive autonomic systems in place to operate
            their neural sonar. Not only do they generate (encode) and process
            (decode) various sophisticated sonar signals, they focus sonic
            energy at targets of interest <em>and</em> actively adjust their
            sonar transmission frequencies away from those of nearby bats to
            reduce signal interference.

            Meanwhile, in neuroscience land, many of our most famous
            computational vision models bear little resemblance to these more
            attention-driven biological systems. Consider the incredibly
            successful ResNet image classifier. It reads entire images, breaks
            them down into spatio-temporal chunks, then assembles those chunks
            all back together into increasingly complex groups of pixels for
            grouping and labeling. And yes, there is ample evidence for our
            visual cortex doing at least highly similar spatio-temporal
            filtering<sup id="fnref:8"
              ><a href="#fn:8" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"
                >8</a
              ></sup
            >
            and layered synthesis of these signals. However, Resnet processes
            the entire image, every time. It has no concept of three-dimensional
            space other than what it has memorized, no representation of what is
            most important, and no way to direct its attention to (disregard or
            prioritize) parts of an image. So, while pieces of Resnet resemble
            some pieces of biological brains, its overall computational
            architecture doesn&rsquo;t really trace back to any biological
            systems. The success of ResNet as a model has much more to do with
            its accomplishments as a technology than its ability to explain
            actual biological neural architectures or animal behavior<sup
              id="fnref:9"
              ><a href="#fn:9" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"
                >9</a
              ></sup
            >—the more fundamental aim of science.
          </p>
          <p>
            Yet scientists understandably have the urge to apply ResNet when
            searching to understand the biological brain because its impressive
            performance might indeed help reveal things that <em>can</em> get us
            closer to understanding neurobiology. But because its overall
            architecture resonates with our subjective experience of perception,
            we may also have a natural bias to trust it more readily than we
            should. The human vision system makes us feel very connected to the
            world. It feels like our eyes are taking it all in like a camera
            taking pictures or video. Therefore, it seems like the mind might,
            at some stage, process images like ResNet. It is tempting to dismiss
            the unconscious mechanisms of eye movement as boring biological
            engineering details—a distraction from the really interesting stuff
            that makes up human perception and thought—when the very opposite
            (or neither!) could be true.
          </p>
          <p>
            Back to idealism and materialism. So while we are not literally
            living in Berkeleyan world of ideas, the vast bulk of our perceptive
            reality is a somewhat Berkeleyan mental construct. Our brain has
            made us a personal holodeck<sup id="fnref:10"
              ><a href="#fn:10" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"
                >10</a
              ></sup
            >
            very much tuned for evolutionary survival. Disbanding this bias of
            objectivity first leaves us with even more mysteries about how minds
            work. However, a major thrust of this scene analysis paper is that
            scientists should design experiments that account for the
            complexities animal perception. What these means in practice is to
            step away from experiments with &ldquo;pure&rdquo; dots and lines to
            ones in ecologically relevant conditions. While these experiments
            are more difficult to perform, they end up being more productive,
            because the minds we are studying are highly tuned for survival in
            that specific environment. Doing so puts scientific observation more
            directly in the driver&rsquo;s seat, and gives us a chance of seeing
            ourselves in a way that that pierces the veil of our own controlled
            hallucinations.

                  There is an epistemological theory based on this idea of

                  and the introductory chapters outline how the limits of
                  physical chemistry drive to work as locally as possible, where
                  molecular proceses can occur much more efficiently than
                  generating expensive electrical pulse trains—especially over
                  longer distances.&#160;<a
