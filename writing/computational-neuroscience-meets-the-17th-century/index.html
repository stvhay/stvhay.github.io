          Descartes famously kicked off an era of Western philosophy with his
          famous statement &ldquo;Cogito, ergo sum&rdquo; (I think, therefore I
          am). He went on to develop a dualistic theory of mind and body. The
          theory posits that the world is composed of fundamentally two types of
          &lsquo;stuff&rsquo;: spirit and matter&ndash;and that these two types
          of stuff interact with each other. For a long time, most bought into
          this idea, but in modern circles of philosophy, it has largely gone
          out of fashion in favor of materialism (in various forms).
        </p>
        <p>
          In the 17th century, things weren&rsquo;t quite as settled. Irish
          philosopher George Berkeley believed the opposite of
          materialism&ndash;the world (including all matter) was composed only
          of ideas
          <sup id="fnref:1"
            ><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup
          >. Like materialists, he didn&rsquo;t really understand how dualism
          could make much sense (how does spirit interact with matter exactly?).
          My question is:
          <strong
            >does idealism offer us any relevant perspective when we study
            neuroscience</strong
          >?

          summarized the current state of neuroscience research on scene
          analysis&ndash;the study of how our brain turns converts sense-data
          into an internal representation of the world we see around us. It then
          argued that scene analysis is not only an incredibly hard problem, but
          much of our study of this problem fails to address very fundamental
          and obvious questions.
        </p>
        <p>
          It turns out that most scene analysis research is conducted with very
          simplified forms&ndash;lines and basic geometric figures. Arguably,
          this makes sense because it provides a controlled experimental
          environment. Unfortunately, while the research has given us many
          useful insights, we remain stuck on how we take this simplified
          experiment and map it to ecologically relevant scene analysis problems
          that all animals are constantly solving.
        </p>
        <p>
          As I was reading, I was thinking about Berkeley&rsquo;s idealism. As I
          learn more about human perception, more evidence is presented that our
          perceptual world is far more like a Star Trek holodeck&ndash;a
          constructed reality&ndash;than an objective projection of sense-data.
          Not only is our brain is deeply involved at every point in this
          process, it constructs perception from a surprisingly tiny subset of
          the information we perceive. So, while I don&rsquo;t literally think
          the world is <strong>literally</strong> built of ideas, it is not a
          totally unreasonable way to approach how we study perception.
        </p>

          As an example, saccades are rapid eye movements that constantly shift
          our gaze. The movements are essential for our ability to process
          visual information because we simply don&rsquo;t have the bandwidth to
          take all of our visual field in without some form of multiplexing<sup
            id="fnref:2"
            ><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup
          >. Our brain controls where our eyes are pointed based on a mix of
          unconscious neural control systems tracking our head, body, and eye
          position; random <strong>saccade</strong> and
          <strong>microsaccade</strong> movement, as well as high-level
          task-driven signals that determine our attention. All of the
          high-acuity visual data we get (e.g. detail and color) comes via this
          narrow field of view, and the rest we fill in with prior knowledge and
          expectations and much more limited peripheral visual data.
        </p>

          This motif recurs throughout the animal kindgom. The scene analysis
          paper discusses jumping spiders that have three pairs of different
          kinds of eyes&ndash;only one pair providing detail, and doing so on a
          narrow vertical dimension. The spider uses these eyes to scan its
          visual field horizontally like a crazed dot-matrix
          <a
            href="https://youtu.be/A_vXA058EDY?t=23"
            target="_blank"
            rel="noopener noreferrer"
            >printer</a
          >. Like us, the spider then assembles these samples into a
          three-dimensional representation of the world&ndash;the only way to
          explain its complex behaviors.
        </p>

          Bats have even more impressive autonomic systems in place to operate
          their neural sonar. Not only do they generate (encode) and process
          (decode) various aural sonar signals, they focus these waves at
          targets of interest, and adjust sonar transmission frequencies away
          from those of nearby bats.
        </p>
        <p>
          Meanwhile, some of our most famous computational models of vision bear
          little resemblance to these attention-driven biological systems. For
          example, ResNet takes entire images, breaks them down into
          spatio-frequency chunks, then pieces it all back together into
          increasingly complex groups of pixels for grouping and labeling.
          Resnet has no concept of three-dimensional space other than what it
          has memorized, no opinions on whether it should or should not be
          paying attention to the things it identifies, and its computational
          structure doesn&rsquo;t have obvious traceability back to biological
          systems. The success of ResNet has much more to do with its
          accomplishments as a technology than how it can explain the function
          of biological neural systems or animal behavior.
        </p>
        <p>
          Yet we have the urge to apply ResNet to our search to understand the
          biological brain because of its impressive performance and because it
          resonates with our lived experience of perception. The human vision
          system makes us feel very connected to the world. It feels like our
          eyes are like cameras taking pictures or video. Therefore, it seems
          like the mind might process images like ResNet. The unconscious
          mechanisms of eye movement could seem like boring biological
          engineering details&ndash;a distraction from the really interesting
          stuff that makes up human perception and thought.
        </p>

          So while we are not literally living in Berkeleyan world of ideas, the
          vast bulk of our perceptive reality can be viewed as a Berkeleyan
          mental construct. Our brain has made ourselves a holodeck<sup
            id="fnref1:1"
            ><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup
          >. Disbanding our own percetual ideas about how our mind works leaves
          us with an even larger mystery. A major point of this scene analysis
          paper is that we really should accept that and more closely examine
          the mechanisms of animal perception to inform the direction of
          research. Doing so puts direct scientific observation in the
          driver&rsquo;s seat, and gives us a more unbiased view into the
          functioning of our minds.
