            <h2>Welcome</h2>
            <p>
                I am a multidisciplinary engineer with extensive experience in
                energy systems, nuclear power, and data science. I hold degrees
                in computer science, electrical engineering, mechanical
                engineering, and business. I've founded innovative teams like
                the Digital Intelligence group at Fluence Energy to integrate
                machine learning into grid-scale energy storage, and led
                critical initiatives such as the StuxNet response for the
                nuclear Navy.

                I am seeking a PhD to more deeply understand the impact of
                Artifical Intelligence on society at large. I am interested
                creating explainable and traceable AI systems for use in safety
                critical applications, defining risk evaluation strategies for
                deploying AI systems, and using neural models to make digital
                art that deepens our understanding of perceptual diversity and
                subjective experience. (<a

                        This project aims to let people see through another's
                        eyes. We will simulate the subjective experience of face
                        blindness (prosopagnosia) through augmented reality (AR)
                        manipulation of facial features. Informed by research on
                        neural encoding in the fusiform face area, the system
                        captures live video input and distorts faces by altering
                        their geometry and texture. The aim of the project is to
                        accurately simulate the subjective experience of someone
                        with prosopagnosia, allowing for an immersive
                        exploration of how disrupted facial recognition impacts
                        perception and social interaction. By merging
                        neuroscience insights with AR technology, this work
                        contributes to both the artistic exploration and
                        scientific understanding of face perception disorders.

                        I wanted to make a retrogaming platform for my nephews,
                        and this project turned into me briefly maintaining a

                        project. My work was focused on ARM boards with the
                        RK3588(S) chipset, such as the

                        I also managed to get a cool patch into the underlying
